Super Resolution CNN is a Deep Convolutional Network suggested by Chao Dong et al for Image Super-Resolution problem, i.e. to convert a low resolution image to a high resolution scale. It was a breakthrough in the SR problem and surpassed many state of the art techniques like the bicubic baseline and the sparse-coding-based method.
